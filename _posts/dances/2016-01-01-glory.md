Source: This traditional children's play party from the streets of New York
gives us a chance to "carol," using the old meaning of the word "to dance." Join
hands in a circle and pick a leader to march around outside the circle in the
opposite direction from the inner circle's movement. As the leader sings "one,
two, three, follow me" he taps individuals to join hands with him in the outer
ring until only one is left in the center. Then "all bow to the mountain." The
"mountain" becomes the new leader.

> Let's all sing glory to the mountain,  
> The mountain is so high,  
> It reaches to the sky,  
> And it's one, two, three, follow me,  
> And we'll all sing glory to the mountain, etc.  
> [Or, ending] And we'll all bow to the mountain.
