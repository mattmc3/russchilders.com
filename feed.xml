        <title>The Story Quilt</title>

Program By Russ and Barb Childers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bear Paw The “Bear Paw” quilt block shown here echoes the name which Russ and
Barb Childers created for themselves in 1983: Bear Foot! The STORY QUILT of Russ
and Barb Childers takes students on an interactive, musical journey of the
imagination. Audiences discover family stories, proverbs and word play, folk
beliefs and folkways - but especially the stories, songs, dances, and games from
Appalachian traditions. In the past, the fabrics that made up a handmade quilt
often came from bits and pieces of a family’s discarded clothing. If those
scraps could talk, what memories would they reveal for today’s child? Today, the
artists use fiddle and banjo - and a full size quilt – to find those threads
that run true through our lives and connect our past to the present. From an
actual 65” x 45” Story Quilt with 12 different quilt block designs, children
choose from the blocks handmade by the artist’s family and receive a story (and
a fun-filled history lesson) unique to that pattern. For example, “See Saw” is a
string trick learned from the artist’s mother and now passed on to a willing
child; “Shoo Fly” might be a delicious pie, but students sing and dance it, too;
“Bow Tie” demonstrates the optical illusions of squares and triangles; “Nine
Patch” prompts the artists to demonstrate an easy “hands on” way to learn the 9s
multiplication table; “Jacob’s Ladder” was a slave song in 1860s and a protest
song for textile workers in the 1940s; “Fish Block” uncovers a tall tale about
local fishing practices; “Schoolhouse” jumps to life with a banjo song; “Moon
Over the Mountain” stirs up a fiddle tune about a midnight fox chase; and “Jack
Knife” conjures up a Jack Tale – and a dancing limberjack!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historical Background&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since quilting first appeared in Mongolia in 100 B.C., many cultural groups
around the world have engaged in similar piecework, patching together small
scraps of fabric to create an artistic whole. Russ’s grandmother in Eastern
Kentucky and Barb’s mother and grandmother in Ohio created quilts which are
still in use by their families. Barb remembers hearing family stories associated
with each scrap of material making up the Ohio Star quilt of her childhood. That
quilt now hangs on a wall of the Childers’ home in Batavia. At one time quilts
were made for necessity, to provide warmth in the days when wood stoves and
fireplaces inadequately heated small cabins. In those days, a cold winter’s
night might be determined to be a “three quilt night” – or worse! – causing
quilts to be stacked high on the beds. But quilts were more than just practical
objects. They also reflected the maker’s eye for beauty as scraps of leftover
fabrics were lovingly rescued, reused and recycled, combined in pleasing designs
and patterns. Quilting was sometimes a solitary activity in isolated mountain
dwellings, but the task became a welcome social activity when groups of quilters
gathered to complete the quilts at community “quilting bees.” As the English
playwright and poet John Heywood (1497-1580) said “Many hands make light work!”
It is not very hard at all to imagine how scraps of music and stories along with
treasured family traditions were also passed along to the children underfoot at
such events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Student activities to connect with the artist’s visit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These activities are based on patterns of quilt block squares:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pinwheel Pinwheel Create a paper pinwheel based on the quilt pattern Pinwheel.
These directions come from Pinwheels for Peace
http://www.pinwheelsforpeace.com/pinwheeltemplate.html. Shoo Fly Shoo Fly Sing
the “Shoo Fly” song in a call-and-answer style (e.g., 1st line – girls, 2nd
line – boys, 3rd line – both). Visit Songs for Teaching web site to listen and
learn the lyrics. http://www.songsforteaching.com/folk/shooflydontbothermeml.php
Dance “Shoo Fly” as a folk dance. Arrange students in a circle. All face center
with hands joined. For the chorus (“shoo fly don’t bother me”), all raise arms
as move forward 4 beats. All lower arms as move backward 4 beats. Repeat. For
the first half of the verse (“I feel, I feel, I feel, I feel like a morning
star”), slide clockwise for 8 beats, facing center of circle with hands joined.
Slide counterclockwise second half of verse for 8 beats. Repeat from the
beginning. Make an Amish Shoo Fly pie. Find a recipe from NPR’s Splendid Table.
Don’t forget to shoo the flies away!
http://splendidtable.publicradio.org/recipes/dessert_shoofly.html Nine Patch
Nine Patch Use construction paper to make nine 2” square patches. With another
color, make nine more of the same size. Draw a 6” square block on a piece of
paper. Staying inside the border of the larger block, use nine of the same-color
smaller patches to form letters. Fill in any empty spaces with the background
color. Rearrange the patches to make C, H, I, J, L, O, T, and U. How many are
vowels? Consonants? How many words can you spell with those letters? Design a
quilt using one letter turned all four directions. Here is an example using the
letter H:
http://quilting.about.com/od/quiltpatternsprojects/ss/H-Quilt-Pattern.htm Nine
Patch gets its name from the 9 small patches (squares) of the design. Use graph
paper to help you “see” this. If the quilt square measures 9” on each side, what
is the measurement of each “patch?” What does each side of the smaller squares
measure if the large square measures 12”? 15”? Design a whole quilt on graph
paper using the Nine Patch design. Decide whether to make a twin, double, queen,
or king size quilt. You will have to research those sizes and decide how many
Nine Patch blocks will fit in each direction. You will also want to play with
the colors you want to use in your collection of Nine Patches! You can use your
fingers to remember the answers to the 9s multiplication table!
http://www.wikihow.com/Remember-the-9’s-in-Multiplication-Using-Your-Hands Ohio
Star Ohio Star How many points are in an Ohio star? Draw a 6-pointed star by
using 2 triangles. Did you know that Betsy Ross recommended a 5-pointed star for
our nation’s flag over the 6-pointed star that George Washington preferred? Go
to the U. S. History web site for directions on folding and cutting a 5-pointed
star: http://www.ushistory.org/BETSY/flagstar.html Some stars have even more
points. What are the names of all 16 points of a Compass Rose? Here is a
simplified version with only 8 points from Enchanted Learning:
http://www.enchantedlearning.com/geography/printouts/compassrose.shtml Fish
Block Fish Block A “fish tale” is a tall tale, or a story with a nugget of truth
buried in a lot of comic exaggeration. Research some tall tales, also known as
“windies” and whoppers. For some good examples, see Whopper, Tall Tales, and
Other Lies by Alvin Schwartz. Write a “fish tale” using some true events from
your life. None Such None Such Nonesuch, Kentucky, is on the Kentucky River
between Harrodsburg and Lexington and is one of the creative names given to
early Kentucky settlements, such as Hell-Fer-Sartin and Kingdom Come and Mousie
and Marrowbone and Red Hot and Monkey’s Eyebrow. Make up your own story about
the origins of one of these unusual names – or the name of a town in your
locale. See Kentucky Place Names by Robert Rennick. Jacob’s Ladder Jacob’s
Ladder This quilt square design comforts us with a story from the Bible, which
was frequently the only book in pioneer homes. It was not unusual that no one in
the household could read the stories within, but the settlers knew them by
heart. The story of Jacob’s Ladder was a favorite and even retold in song form!
Slaves sang the hymn in 19th century America; Pete Seeger rewrote the chorus and
sang “workers of the South” during a textile workers protest in the ’40s. Find
the lyrics on the Traditional &amp;amp; Folk Songs web site at
http://www.traditionalmusic.co.uk/song-midis/We_Are_Climbing_Jacobs_Ladder.htm.
Sing along with the audio clip! Make a toy called a Jacob’s Ladder. Directions
here: http://www.sermons4kids.com/instructions-ladder-toy.htm. Make a string
figure called Jacob’s Ladder. Directions here:
http://www.frontiernet.net/~steve_glimpse/stringar.html. Keep Your Own Patchwork
Memory!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collect a scrap of fabric from each family member (ask permission first!) to put
together as a patchwork cover on a small journal. Make a pocket inside the book
to hold old photographs of the family members (wearing the clothing from which
the scrap of fabric came, if possible). Write a story based on what might be the
result “if this fabric could talk.” Paint a Quilt Block on Your School, Barn,
Mailbox, or Birdhouse!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donna Sue Grove’s idea started a trail of quilts painted on barns through Adams
County in Ohio. Take the trail or visit Appalachian Discovery online at
http://www.appalachiandiscovery.com/Quilt_Barn_Squares.htm. In Brown County,
Ohio, students designed and painted a barn quilt square as a class project to
enrich their art, math, and heritage in a community project. Contact JoAnn
Gaudio May at the Ripley Union Lewis Huntington School District. Booklist&lt;/p&gt;

A Program By Russ Childers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artist Study Guide Kentucky Center for the Arts Russ Childers demonstrates
creatively that “if you want any more, you have to sing it yourself.” His
Appalachian heritage taught him to learn for himself the stories, songs, music,
and dance of his ancestors. Choose his storytelling program to learn the real
art to storytelling, and you’ll hear why the phrase “and that’s another true
story” follows every whopper. Or make musical instruments from recycled
materials directed by Russ’s old-time ingenuity. Or learn history through the
traditional songs and play parties of the Southern Highlands. Or discover the
blended cultures of Africa, Native America, and the British Isles nestled
together in the mountains of Appalachia through the music in a gourd banjo, a
fiddle, and a dulcimer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play “Button, Button, Who’s Got the Button?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sit in a circle with one player (“It”) in the center. With hands held behind
his/her back, someone in the circle begins passing a button (or pretending to)
to others in the circle. Everyone keeps their hands held behind their back
throughout the game to do this. Players pass (or pretend to pass) and receive
(or pretend to receive) button. When the player in the center (“It”) calls
“Button, button, who’s got the button?” the passing stops. The player in the
center tries to guess who has the button. If the player guesses correctly, the
player gets to be “It” again. If the player guesses wrong, then a new “It” goes
to the center to play again, with the former “It” passing the button this time.
Or try this alternate method with a semicircle of players sitting with their
cupped hands (palms loosely facing) held out together in front of them. The
player with the button passes his cupped hands in between each player’s cupped
hands, dropping button in someone’s hands. Whether or not the player actually
drops the button in someone’s hands, he continues until he has gone through
everyone in the semicircle. Then he says “Button, button, who’s got the button?”
The one who guesses correctly gets to pass the button next time. Research some
other old games that your grandparents and great-grandparents used to play. Try
writing out the directions and “publish” them as a classroom collection. Make
Button Hummers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dig into Grandma’s button box to find the perfect big button. Ask her for a 3’
length of yarn or thin white grocery string, too. Thread the button onto the
length of yarn or string, which has been tied to make a loop. Twirl ends with
button in the center until tightly wound. Gently pull hands away from each other
until button begins to spin and hum as it rewinds itself. See Foxfire Book of
Toys and Games for details. Dress and Feed a Cucumber Baby&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use that last overlarge cucumber from the garden-the one you forgot until it
grew too big for eating. You’ll need pebbles for eyes, a metal spoon to scrape
out the insides of the cucumber and a table knife (or appropriate implement for
the age of the child) to carve the eyes and mouth. Find a scrap of material to
serve for the diaper and a diaper pin to fasten it round the cucumber baby’s
bottom. Cut off the end of the cucumber to scrape out the insides, cutting a
mouth and two tiny eye spaces. Fit the pebbles into the eye sockets, dress the
baby in its diaper. Feed it some mud, and, oops, it’s time to change the baby!
See the story in Foxfire Book of Toys and Games. Or try making a sweet potato
doll and read The Sweet Patootie Doll by Mary Calhoun. What other materials
could you use to make a doll? Read Cornhusk, Silk, and Wishbones by Michelle
Markel. Sing your babies to sleep. Collect the favorite lullabies of your
classroom and “publish” them in a book. If you wish to view a cucumber baby,

&lt;p&gt;Juba this and Juba that, Juba killed a yaller cat, Juba up and Juba down, Juba
runnin’ all around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this challenging hand-patting game that comes from African traditions
carried to the New World, sit cross-legged on the floor. Learn the words to the
Juba song, or pat out this rhythm to any fiddle or banjo tune. Watch out! By the
time you get through the first line “Juba this and Juba that” and start on the
second “Juba killed a yaller cat,” you are one beat off what you were patting
the first time through. For other hand-patting games of the Gullah tradition,
read Bessie Jones’ Step It Down. What other hand-patting games are popular on
your school grounds? JU - Pat your right hand to your right knee. BA - Bring the
back of your right hand up to pat the palm of your left hand that is now over
your right knee. THIS - Bring your right hand back down to pat your right knee
again. AND - Pat your left hand on your left knee. JU - Bring the back of your
left hand up to pat the palm of your right hand that is now over your left knee.
BA - Bring your left hand back down to pat your left knee again. THAT - Pat your
right hand on your right knee… and keep going!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dance a Traditional Play-Party&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dance and play “Bow to the Mountain” as you sing it, according to the tune in
John and Nancy Langstaff’s The Christmas Revels Songbook. Make a circle of
dancers holding hands and moving in a clockwise direction. Choose a leader who
goes around in the opposite direction outside the ring. The leader taps the
shoulders of three children (on “one, two, three” in the song) and they leave
the circle and follow the leader into the outside ring. When the last child is
left in the middle of the ring, everyone stops moving to face into the center
and bows to the “Mountain.” Then the dance begins again with the Mountain as the
new leader. “Oh, we’ll all sing glory to the mountain, the mountain is so high,
it reaches to the sky. And it’s one, two, three, follow me, and we’ll all sing
glory to the mountain,” etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repeat until the last child is left. Then sing “And we’ll all bow to the
mountain.”&lt;/p&gt;

Start an Appalachian Jam Band&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make musical instruments from kitchen trash! See how it’s done in Ty’s One-Man
Band by Mildred Pitts Walter. Need dancers? Make clothespin dancers from
directions in Homemade Instruments by Dallas Cline. Find how to make instruments
there, too, or in books like The Foxfire Book of Toys and Games. Make a box bass
from a recycled large cardboard box, a broom, a pencil, and a string. Play
plastic or metal spoons! Hum the tune on a kazoo made from an empty toilet paper
roll and a piece of wax paper. Blow the jug-made from a clean, empty milk jug or
pop bottle. Don’t throw it away-play the paper bag. Strum rhythm on an old
washboard. Make a canjo (a banjo made from a tin can, a yardstick, and a piece
of string) according to the directions found on Russ Childers’ web site at
http://home.fuse.net/russchilders. Sing a Chicken Song; Make a Chicken Clucker&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C - that’s the way it begins, H - that’s the next letter in, I - that is the
third, C - that’s the fourth letter in that bird, K - that’s a-filling it in, E
- getting near the N. C-H-I-C-K-E-N! That is the way to spell chicken!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save a disposable plastic cup, punch a tiny hole in the bottom, thread a string
through the hole and tie it to a paper clip on the outside of the cup. That will
keep the string from coming back through the hole when you tug on it later. Tie
a one-inch square piece of sponge to the other end of the string. Hole the cup
upside down with the sponge hanging down. Pinch the string with the sponge and
yank gently on the string. (Sometimes it works better if the sponge is damp.)

beady eyes, a beak, and a cockscomb if you like. Find a similar “tin can howler”

        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;appalachian-christmas&quot;&gt;Appalachian Christmas&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intro · Bibliography · Children’s Books · Recorded Music · Activities A Program
By Russ Childers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russ cooks up a recipe for an old-time Appalachian Christmas such as his
ancestors might have celebrated. Seasonal tales, regional music, and songs make
it a uniquely eastern Kentucky product. With food themes that reflect their
holiday spirits, songs whose origins were in the British Isles changed during
their stay in on the American frontier. The Kentucky Wassail Song and The Cherry
Tree Carol are two examples. Banjo, fiddle, and lap dulcimer demonstrate
unfamiliar carols played the old-time mountain way. Children might participate
in an activity that shows how hard everyone had to work to get ready, e.g., The
Farmer’s Wife, as well as a traditional game or dance to show how hard everyone
played when they got the chance. Gifts were simpler then: an orange, a candy
cane, or a single homemade toy would please. The tree was itself a gift to the
whole family. Cut down on a special expedition into the woods, its boughs were
decorated with pictures cut out of magazines, stars made of tinfoil gum
wrappers, and popcorn and berries strung in garlands. Real candles on the tree
were a constant worry to the family, who sat nearby with a water bucket at the
ready! Bibliography - Teacher / Student Resources on Appalachian Celebrations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make and serve traditional wassail / eggnog / mulled cider. See “Mulled Cider”
recipe in Smokehouse Ham, Spoon Bread, &amp;amp; Scuppernong Wine: The Folklore and Art
of Southern Appalachian Cooking. Adult assistance is needed to heat the mixture.
With needle and thread, string popcorn and cranberries for the birds. Fold and
cut paper stars from tinfoil or gum wrappers. Recycle gift-wrap, tinfoil, or
colored sheets of newspaper by making them into paper chains to decorate the
room. Make a pomander ball. Push the spike end of whole cloves into an orange
until entire surface is covered, then roll the orange in arrowroot and tie with
a hanging ribbon. The spicy scent of pomanders was used to freshen closets and
drawers. Make pre-electricity dipped candles. Melt wax in coffee tins and dip
12-15” long wick in wax, let cool, dip, let cool, dip, let cool, until enough
wax is built up. Adult supervision is needed for this. Make cornbread or
biscuits with recipes from an Appalachian cookbook. Then spread with homemade
apple butter or home-churned butter. If you don’t have a churn, Joy of Cooking
claims you can make butter in an electric blender from whipping cream. Fashion
homemade Appalachian toys from ideas in Foxfire Book of Toys and Games. Games&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play a game of forfeits. When 12 Days of Christmas or Children Go Where I Send
Thee is sung as a forfeit game, it becomes a true test of developing memory
skills! For a flavor of Appalachian entertainments, read through the preface of
Ruth Seeger’s American Folk Songs for Christmas or Jean Ritchie’s chapter on
Kentucky Christmas in Singing Family of the Cumberlands. Hold an old-fashioned
spelling bee. Can you spell Appalachia? Wassail? Quilt? Gee-Haw Whimmy Diddle?
Turkey Buzzard? Grasshopper? Hint: find the West Virginia version of the last
two words in Granny Will Your Dog Bite. Divide into teams and guess riddles from
the Appalachian tradition. Refer to James Still’s Appalachian Mother Goose or
May Justus’s Complete Peddler’s Pack. Storytelling &amp;amp; Creative Writing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collect family traditions from class members to compile in handmade books to
give to each child’s family. Trace where these traditions have traveled on a
map. Collect a class cookbook of favorite family recipes and accompany each
recipe with a family anecdote or memory or a related story. The map idea is fun
to try here, too, and can become part of the book. For either of the above
activities, have each class member bring in a small piece of material to make a
patchwork cover. Maybe there is a story connected with the fabric that needs to
be told! Books from the children’s department of the library can supply many
ideas about creating books and covers. Musical/Rhythmic Exercises&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a play party, e.g., sing and dance Glory to the Mountain (described in the
Christmas Revels Songbook). Dance the Virginia Reel or another longwise dance
from Richard Chase’s collection of Appalachian Old Songs &amp;amp; Singing Games or
Singing Games and Playparty Games. Act out The Busy Farmer’s Wife, cooking apple
butter, churning butter, chewing taffy, shooing chickens, found in many
children’s activity books, e.g., Juba This and Juba That by Virginia Tashjian.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Banjo from Africa to America</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-banjo-from-africa-to-america&quot;&gt;The Banjo from Africa to America&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intro · Bibliography · Activities A Program By Russ Childers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you looking for something unique in a cultural diversity presentation? My
program reveals the cross-cultural transport and continental drift of the
5-string banjo from its African origins to the southern Appalachian Highlands.
Contrary to popular belief, the banjo is not an American invention from the
Appalachian Mountains but is, in fact, an African instrument. Examples of its
evolution are exhibited: a West African style gourd banjo a hand-carved fretless
mountain banjo a 1922-manufactured resonator banjo. Different playing styles are
demonstrated showing African, Celtic, and Native American influences. As an
illustration of African syncopation, audiences learn to pat juba. Or they may
learn to drone like a bagpipe, another cultural import that effected a change in
banjo construction. Even banjo construction materials-from gourd to real-life
groundhog skin to recycled tin can-help audiences understand how early banjo
creators made music with what is at hand. A fascinating mini-history lesson
comes with the banjo: who were its first players? What negative impact during
the Minstrel Era changed all this? And what does Rock and Roll have to do with
it? With a live performance of the music to illustrate the migration of the
banjo from Africa to the Appalachian highlands, audiences gain an insight into
the rich cultural diversity reflected in one of America’s oldest traditional
music forms.&lt;/p&gt;

Activities&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make Musical Instruments&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make a tin canjo. Visit Russ Childers’ website at
http://home.fuse.net/russchilders for directions. Make an oatmeal box banjo. See
the video Making and Playing Homemade Musical Instruments by Cathy Fink and
Marcy Marxer from Homespun Video. Make a bleach bottle banjo. Find instructions
in You Can Teach Yourself to Make Music with Homemade Instruments by Mark
Nelson, Mel Bay, 1995. Try One of These Gourd Projects&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grow long-necked gourds from seed. To order old-fashioned long-necked gourd
seeds online, contact the website: Lewis Mountain Herbs
http://www.bright.net/~mtherbs/ Craft your own gourd project. Besides banjos,
other things have traditionally been made from gourds, i.e., birdhouses, water
and soap dippers. See Thornburg’s website for a discussion of gourds:
http://www.gourdbanjo.com/GBhtml/about.html One of the code songs from
Underground Railroad days was “Follow the Drinking Gourd.” Slaves found their
way to freedom by following landmarks and stars according to the directions
given in the song. A children’s book by Jean Winters called Follow the Drinking
Gourd gives a brief history along with the music for the song. Folk Songs of the
Southern Appalachians by Jean Ritchie describes “The Old Soap-Gourd” as a
play-party dance and song. The play-party may also be found in Jean Ritchie’s
Swapping Song Book. Experiment with Musical/Rhythmic Exercises; Demonstrate the
Banjo’s Percussive Heritage&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practice Celtic droning. One half of class sings tune while other half drones a
sympathetic note, e.g., like bagpipes. This imitates the droning effect that the
short fifth string on the banjo has from the influence of its Irish-Scots
players. Work on some body percussions from African tradition (see Bessie Jones’
Step It Down; Making Musical Things by Ann Wiseman; Traditional American Dance
Book by Rick Meyers) in order to understand the banjo’s syncopation: Juba
Hambone Teach the “Indian,” a mountain clog dance step inspired by Eastern
Cherokee dance tradition. Traditional American Dance Book by Rick Meyers and
Clog Dance in the Appalachians by Jerry Duke both describe the Eastern
Cherokee/African tie-in to Appalachian music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(some verses Gerry Milnes, some Jean Ritchie, some original)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What shall we do with the baby-o&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What shall we do with the baby-o &lt;br /&gt;

That’s what we’ll do with the baby-o (2x)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What shall we do with the baby-o &lt;br /&gt;
We’ll stick a finger in her eye &lt;br /&gt;
That will surely make her cry &lt;br /&gt;
That’s what we’ll do with the baby-o (2x)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What shall we do with the baby-o &lt;br /&gt;
We’ll stick our fingers in our ears &lt;br /&gt;
That will make her hard to hear &lt;br /&gt;
That’s what we’ll do with the baby-o (2x)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arne’s verse:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What shall we do with the baby-o &lt;br /&gt;
We’ll box her up and send her far &lt;br /&gt;
She won’t get back by foot or car &lt;br /&gt;
That’s what we’ll do with the baby-o (2x)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What shall we do with the baby-o &lt;br /&gt;
We’ll tickle her nose and tickle her chin &lt;br /&gt;

That’s what we’ll do with the baby-o (2x)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What shall we do with the baby-o &lt;br /&gt;
We’ll dance her north and dance her south &lt;br /&gt;
We’ll pour a little moonshine in her mouth &lt;br /&gt;
That’s what we’ll do with the baby-o (2x)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Railroad Track</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: “Railroad Track,” West Virginia version - see www.bubbaguitar.com. A Look at Southern Squares&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All join hands and make a big ring &lt;br /&gt;
Circle to the left with your pretty little thing. &lt;br /&gt;
All the way around and half way back &lt;br /&gt;
LADIES in the lead, gents in back. &lt;br /&gt;
Hold where you are and settle down &lt;br /&gt;
Swing your partner one time around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LADIES in the center back to back &lt;br /&gt;
GENTS you walk the railroad track. &lt;br /&gt;
Pass your partner BY ONE &lt;br /&gt;
Swing the next. &lt;br /&gt;
Don’t forget to place HIM back&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LADIES walk the railroad track. &lt;br /&gt;
Pass your partner BY TWO &lt;br /&gt;
Swing the next. &lt;br /&gt;
Don’t forget to place HER back&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GENTS you walk the railroad track. &lt;br /&gt;
Pass your partner BY THREE &lt;br /&gt;
Swing the next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(continue as above until all have danced with each other; partners will be next in line to dance)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get your partner when you come around. &lt;br /&gt;
Swing HER out and promenade. &lt;br /&gt;
Promenade around that ring &lt;br /&gt;
Promenade your pretty little thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teaching Words&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LADIES step into center and stand back to back facing out. &lt;br /&gt;
GENTS walk single file counterclockwise (ccw) all the way around the ladies, &lt;br /&gt;
pass partner, &lt;br /&gt;
stop in front of the next lady and swing with her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, at the finish of this swing, &lt;br /&gt;
LADIES put the gents in the center back to back. &lt;br /&gt;
LADIES now promenade single file ccw all the way around, &lt;br /&gt;
pass ORIGINAL partner and next gent, &lt;br /&gt;
stop before the third gent and swing with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GENT puts the lady in the center back to back &lt;br /&gt;
and continues ccw all the way around the ladies, &lt;br /&gt;
passes the last one he swung &lt;br /&gt;
and stops in front of the next lady to swing with her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repeat, alternating between gents and ladies until back with partners.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Glory to the Mountain</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: This traditional children’s play party from the streets of New York
gives us a chance to “carol,” using the old meaning of the word “to dance.” Join
hands in a circle and pick a leader to march around outside the circle in the
opposite direction from the inner circle’s movement. As the leader sings “one,
two, three, follow me” he taps individuals to join hands with him in the outer
ring until only one is left in the center. Then “all bow to the mountain.” The
“mountain” becomes the new leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s all sing glory to the mountain, &lt;br /&gt;
The mountain is so high, &lt;br /&gt;
It reaches to the sky, &lt;br /&gt;
And it’s one, two, three, follow me, &lt;br /&gt;
And we’ll all sing glory to the mountain, etc. &lt;br /&gt;
[Or, ending] And we’ll all bow to the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Forward Up Six</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: This is based upon a visiting couple call that Russ learned from
Cincinnati caller Martha Danforth. Although she used a rhyming patter call, Russ
uses prompts that don’t necessarily rhyme and are not the exact words given
here. Note that instructions are directed to the gents. In the figures, the
instructions are to the lead gent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All join hands and circle to the left… &lt;br /&gt;
…Now back to the right, you’re going wrong. &lt;br /&gt;
When you get home, swing your partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BREAK: Allemande your corner with the old left hand &lt;br /&gt;
Now back to your partner with a right and left grand &lt;br /&gt;
Rights and lefts around the hall &lt;br /&gt;
Meet your partner, promenade all&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIGURE: First couple out to couple number two &lt;br /&gt;
Circle up four, that’s what you do &lt;br /&gt;
Leave your lady where she be &lt;br /&gt;
Now on to the next and circle up three&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steal that lady in your right hand &lt;br /&gt;
Circle up four, you’re doing grand &lt;br /&gt;
Leave her there, go home alone…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forward up six and six fall back &lt;br /&gt;
Two lone gents go back to back &lt;br /&gt;
Right hands high and left hands low &lt;br /&gt;
Twirl the gals and let ‘em go&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Repeat the “forward up six” pattern three more times until lead gent comes back to his original partner.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swing your partners!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BREAK&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIGURE: Repeat with gent number two going out to couple number three, four, and
one, followed by the “forward up six” pattern until gent number two meets his
original partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swing your partners!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BREAK&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIGURE: Repeat with gent number three going out to couple number four, one, and
two, followed by the “forward up six” pattern until gent number three meets his
original partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swing your partners!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BREAK&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIGURE: Repeat with gent number four going out to couple number one, two, and
three, followed by the “forward up six” pattern until gent number four meets his

        <title>Floating Down the River (play party)</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;source-traditional-play-party-from-tennessee-see-nancy--john-langstaff-collection-sally-go-round-the-moon&quot;&gt;Source: Traditional play party from Tennessee. See Nancy &amp;amp; John Langstaff collection, Sally Go Round the Moon.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Directions: Need odd number, at least 9, but 17 is best. Make a circle of 8 (or
16) with one lone child in the center of the ring. Children join hands in one
large circle, with the lone child in the center. All circle to the left, singing
and circling slowly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re floating down the river &lt;br /&gt;
We’re floating down below &lt;br /&gt;
We’re floating down the river &lt;br /&gt;
To the O-hi-O!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As children circle and sing “we’re floating down the river,” the child in the
center slowly spins the opposite direction with arm outstretched, pointing. At
the end of “O-hi-O!” wherever her finger points is her new partner in the
center. Then she grabs that partner; all sing and clap in place as the two in
the center hold hands and spin or jump up and down or whatever they want to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(faster) &lt;br /&gt;
Two in the boat and you can’t jump, Josie &lt;br /&gt;
Two in the boat and you can’t jump, Josie &lt;br /&gt;
Two in the boat and you can’t jump, Josie &lt;br /&gt;
Oh my! Susan Brown!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On “Brown,” the children all take that as the signal (as in “settle down,
Brown!”) to resume slowly-paced circling to the left as all sing “We’re floating
down the river” again. The two children in the center each spin slowly in the
opposite direction with arms outstretched and again point to their new partners,
grabbing them for the next part: &lt;br /&gt;
Four in the boat and you can’t jump, Josie, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This keeps repeating (“Eight in the boat,” “Sixteen in the boat”) until no one
is in the outer ring and everyone is jumping in the middle. Be sure to end by
having all children join hands in large circle again to finish with a final
“We’re floating down the river… to the O-hi-o.” THE END.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EXTRA ENDING: Finally, this is the perfect opportunity to keep hands (“Nobody
let go!”) and lead the children in a snake dance that winds up in the center and
unwinds again from the center and around the room as the fiddler keeps
playing…&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Make a Dulci-can</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/russchilders.com/assets/images/painted.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Painted Dulci-can&quot; title=&quot;Painted Dulci-can&quot; style=&quot;float:left;height:200px;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/russchilders.com/assets/images/bridge.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dulci-can bridge&quot; title=&quot;Dulci-can bridge&quot; style=&quot;float:left;height:200px;margin-left:.5em;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em style=&quot;display:block;clear:both;&quot;&gt;Dulci-can with painted coffee can. Dave Whitacre’s modified bridge design creates a louder sound.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dulcimer, a word that comes from the Latin dulce melos, means “sweet sound.” A
lap dulcimer is a traditional Appalachian folk instrument played in the Southern
Highlands. Brought into the mountain wilderness by European settlers who
migrated west from eastern seaboard cities, the dulcimer carried their Scots,
Irish, and English tunes from Celtic homelands to America’s interior. The
mountain dulcimer has ancient roots that probably reach back to Scandinavian
origins. It is mentioned in the Book of Daniel 3:5 with other instruments of the
time making “…the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery,
dulcimer, and all kinds of musick.” It is interesting to note that, according to
Sara Johnson, the Kitchen Musician®, “the word in the original Hebrew text is
now known to mean something other than ‘dulcimer’; and it is believed the King
James translators were doing the best they could with knowledge available to
them at the time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dulci-can shown here is a straight-ahead utilitarian version of its more
graceful hand-carved wooden ancestor of hourglass or teardrop shape. Made from a
fretted fingerboard, three geared tuners, three guitar strings, and a recycled
coffee can for a resonator, it can be played on a lap or a table top for even
greater resonation. This particular design comes from the fertile imagination of
David Ball of Knoxville, Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Materials needed to complete this project are listed below. This project is
intended as an on-site, guided activity taught by the artist. Expect to pay
$20.00 to cover materials for each student.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fret wire&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 geared tuners&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wooden bridge&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2-012 and 1-022 ball end strings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Large coffee can&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Board (pre-cut, pre-drilled, pre-slotted)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: If you want to try and cut the fret slots, go to Doug Sparling’s
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dougsparling.com/software/fretcalc/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fret Calculator&lt;/a&gt;
for fret spacing measurements.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Map your migration</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a map that shows the 420 counties officially designated as the
Appalachian Region. On a United States, North American, Western Hemisphere, or
World Map, track your family’s migration. Compare with others in the class.
Compile a composite map of migrations. The Appalachian residents migrated from
Europe, British Isles, Africa, Native America…. and are still migrating
today….&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Collect a story from your ancestors</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Who are your ancestors? Make a family tree to find out. Ask questions and tape
the answers or write them down. A good way to jog the memories of relatives is
to show them an old quilt and ask for the story of its making. Other things work
well, too: a treasured piece of furniture that’s been in the family a long time,
an old dish lovingly stored in the corner cupboard, a faded photograph. Along
the way collect the family stories you hear from your parents, your
grandparents, or favorite uncle or aunt. Polish one up and share it with your
classmates. The class could put their family stories together in a book.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Learn the Virginia Reel</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most popular dances of the Southern Highlands. One good
source for the dance is Traditional American Dance Book by Rick Meyers, 1983.
Directions from the traditional dance community in Norfolk, Virginia, were found
on the Seven Cities of Southeastern Virginia Folk Dance Connection
&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20040214121457/http://www.norfolk.folkdancer.com/VAReel.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;web site&lt;/a&gt;
and are included below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dance is performed in long lines, up and down the hall.
Imagine clearing the cabin of furniture and rolling up the carpet in order to
have a dance! The fiddlers stood in the doorways to take up less space and to be
heard equally well in both rooms of the cabin. &lt;em&gt;“Stay all night, stay a little
longer…“&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Instructions for Dancing the Virginia Reel
------------------------------------------

Longways dance in sets of 5 or 6 couples. 
All the men on the &quot;right&quot; when looking down the hall,
all the ladies on the left. ( Stand across from your partner)

Join hands in long lines, Go forward and back 8 beats of music

Right hand turn your partner 8 beats

Left Hand turn your partner 8 beats

Do-si-do (back to back) with partner 8 beats

Top couple take two hands,
Sashay 16 beats down the center of the set and back 

Top couple &quot;reel the set&quot; (top couple only)
-- hook right elbows with partner, turn 1-1/2 times. 
Top gent then goes to the first lady in the ladies line,
top lady goes to the first man in the man&#39;s line 
and they turn left elbows once around.

Top man and woman then meet again in the middle, 
turn right elbow once around with each other,
then left elbow with the next person in line, etc.
Continue &quot;right to your partner, left to the next&quot;
until the top couple has &quot;reeled&quot; all the way down the line.
This takes about... 48 beats (or so...)

Top couple then sashays back up the middle to the top, and separate from each
other. They &quot;peel off &quot; down the respective outside of the lines, (men down the
men&#39;s side, lady down the ladies side) go to the bottom and make a two-handed
arch. All the other couples follow them down to the bottom and up through the
arch, leaving the top couple at the bottom, and the second couple at the top
ready to start the dance over!!

That takes about 32 beats (or so)

***************************************

A line of 5 (or 6) couples can make it one time through the whole dance in two
repetitions of a 64-beat tune. (Notice all of the above figures &quot;add up&quot; to 128
beats.

It will not always match the music exactly, though. The more important part is
to keep smiling and have fun!!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Make a can-jo</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;figure figure-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/russchilders.com/assets/images/can-jo_drawing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;can-jo&quot; title=&quot;can-jo&quot; style=&quot;height:250px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With recycled products and kitchen trash, children can create their own music on
their own manufactured instruments. Appalachian musicians sometimes had to use
what was at hand when store-bought musical instruments were not available or
affordable. The Foxfire Books are full of examples of this type of
resourcefulness. The can-jo is Russ’s adaptation of the traditional washtub bass
that is commonly used in Appalachian musical settings. Materials needed: large
coffee can, wooden yardstick, string, paperclip, 2 nuts and bolts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Directions: Punch a hole in the center of the bottom of a tin can (lid has been
removed). Setting open end of can on a counter, drill two holes through the
yardstick and the can so that stick extends up from closed end. Fasten with 2
nuts and bolts. Drill hole in other end of stick. Push string through the hole
in the can and fasten to a paper clip inside the can so that the string cannot
pop out. Stretch the string to the hole in the far end of the yardstick; tie
securely and tighten as much as possible. (See picture.)&lt;/p&gt;
