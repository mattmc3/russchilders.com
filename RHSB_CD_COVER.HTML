<h2 id="rabbit-hash-string-band">Rabbit Hash String Band</h2>

<p>RABBIT HASH STRING BAND formed in the early 1990s on the banks of the Ohio River
in the sleepy river town of Rabbit Hash, Kentucky. Old-time fiddler and Rabbit
Hash resident Tom Taylor pulled together Warren and Judy Waldron with Russ and
Barb Childers to play Skillet Lickers music of the 1920s. Today the foursome –
Warren (fiddle), Judy (guitar), Russ (banjo), and Barb (banjo uke) – “play it
forward” to a new generation of listeners.</p>

<h2 id="cd-track-selection">CD Track Selection</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Soldier’s Joy</strong> - Key of D. Warren sings the most widespread and oldest of
old time tunes. It’s been around the English-speaking world since the 18th
century, popular in both Revolutionary and Civil Wars. Tim McKenzie plays
guitar with us on this track that we recorded for his Windsor Knotts
Forgotten… But Not Gone CD in 2011.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>High on the Mountain</strong> (written by Ola Belle Reed) - Key of A. Barb, lead
vocal; Judy, harmony. This track is our previously recorded cover of the Ola
Belle Reed classic for the Music for the Mountains compilation CD and benefit
concert in 2011 as part of a project to raise awareness about the process of
mountaintop removal. Copies of the Music for the Mountains CD are available
for sale online from Ohio Citizen Action @ www.ohiocitizen.org and
Kentuckians for the Commonwealth @ www.kftc.org. In a 1976 interview
published by Smithsonian Folkways, Ola Belle Reed said about this song “you
cannot separate your lifestyle, your religion, your politics from your
music.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cotton Eyed Joe</strong> - Key of G. Warren, lead vocal; Judy and Barb, harmony.
“Where’d you come from, where’d you go?” We’ve seen many meanings for the
term “cotton-eyed” including blindness from glaucoma or syphilis or
blind-drunk from moonshine. This here’s a Carter Brothers-inspired rollicking
song about an unrepentant reprobate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rabbit Hash Kentucky</strong> (written by Tom Taylor) - Key of D. Warren, lead
vocal; Judy, Barb, and Russ harmonies. Tom Taylor created this tribute to the
real life characters of his hometown on the banks of the Ohio River. The song
(and Tom, along with our band) was later featured in the 2004 documentary
Rabbit Hash - Center of the Universe. Though Tom no longer plays with the
band, his legendary jokes and one-liners remain an indelible part of the
band’s repertoire.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Polly Put the Kettle On</strong> - Key of D. Our musical heroes, the Skillet
Lickers of north Georgia sang “Molly put the kettle on, Jenny blow the dinner
horn, Molly put the kettle on, we’ll all take tea.” Even without words, this
tune boils up a good head of steam just right for dancing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rabbit in the Lowland</strong> - Key of A. Warren, lead vocal; Judy, Barb, and
Russ, harmonies. Always on the hunt of a good rabbit tune, we tried to
capture Brad Lefwich’s interpretation of a George “Shortbuckle” Roarke field
recording.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Old Lonesome Blues</strong> - Key of C. Barb, lead vocal, and Judy, harmony,
attempt to channel the Bowman Sisters, Jenny (14) and her older sister
Pauline (16), who recorded this sassy song in 1929. Their dad was old-time
fiddler Charlie Bowman. We like how Warren “shivers” the fiddle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="assets/music/Run_Mountain.mp3">Run Mountain</a></strong> - Key of G. Warren, lead
vocal; Judy, Barb, Russ, harmonies. Don’t blame us. J. E. Mainer and his
Mountaineers made us do it, but Tim Wilson’s version still inspires those of
us who remember Company Comin’s premier fiddler. Run or Roan Mountain? Chug,
check, or chuck a little hill? We don’t know. When in doubt, sing louder.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sittin’ by the River on the Levee</strong> - Key of A. Warren, lead vocal; Judy,
Barb, Russ, harmonies. We credit Jeff Warner and Jeff Davis as well as the
Double Decker String Band for this a capella work song collected in 1939 by
Herbert Halpert from Josephine Douglas at the Parchman Women’s Correctional
Farm in Mississippi.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Hard Road to Travel</strong> - Key of D. We think we all learned this from Jack
Bunch in Cincinnati jam sessions during the 1970s.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Raccoon on the Rail</strong> - Key of G. Barb, lead vocal. Barb found words to
what was probably an 19th century minstrel piece “Settin’ on a Rail” in an
old children’s book Negro Folk Songs. She recognized the melody as the
old-time fiddle chewn “Possum on a Rail.” Everybody shout encore!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Tennessee Mountain Fox Chase</strong> - Key of C. Imagine a mountain. Imagine a
moonlit night. Imagine baying hounds chasing a frantic fox. Warren and Russ
shake the fox and hounds right outta that tune while Judy and Barb just try
to keep up. Warren says his version come from the playing of Dudley Vance of
Vance’s Tennessee Breakdowners.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sail Away Ladies</strong> - Key of G. Warren, lead vocal; Judy, Barb, Russ,
harmonies. This song was present in white and black traditions from the time
between the Revolutionary and Civil Wars. It’s not hard to imagine that
crews on steamboats helped pass this song up and down the Ohio and
Mississippi Rivers. We like to think the ladies of the song refer to the
highly ornamented steamboats: “Don’t you rock ‘em!” Warren’s source for this
one is Uncle Dave Macon and the Fruit Jar Drinkers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sugar Babe</strong> - Key of A. Barb, lead vocal; Judy, harmony. Interpret the
double meaning of the lyrics however you like! We take our singing cues for
this mournful modal tune from many sources, one of them being Norman Edmonds
and the Old Timers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Georgia Wagoner</strong> - Key of C. Back in the day, a wagoner hauled freight on
a mule-drawn wagon. Another instrumental from the Skillet Lickers’
repertoire, just right for Judy or Russ to call a square dance. Swing your
partners!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sandy River Belle</strong> - Key of G. Russ and Warren fire up two different
versions of the same tune and get that ol’ steamboat moving along. Russ
learned the banjo part from Elmer Bird of Hurricane, West Virginia. Warren’s
fiddle part come from listening to an unnamed fiddler on a live radio
broadcast. Their syncopated rhythms help us see a paddlewheel churning up
the waters as it fades off into the misty distance.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>All songs traditional, except sel. 2 and 4.</p>

<p><strong><em>Where I Want To Be</em></strong> recorded and produced by Rabbit Hash String Band,
2011-13</p>
